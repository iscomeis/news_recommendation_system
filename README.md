# **News Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity**

- In the era of information overload, analyzing text data has become a crucial task for extracting meaningful insights and enhancing user experience. This project focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore the similarities among news. By leveraging the power of cosine similarity, we aim to uncover relationships between different news articles based on their content.

- The project utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization method to transform textual data into numerical format. Following this transformation, cosine similarity is calculated to measure the degree of similarity between different summaries in the dataset. Our dataset comprises news summaries from various categories, providing a rich ground for analysis and exploration.

- The dataset can be accessed from [Statso's News Recommendation Case Study](https://statso.io/news-recommendation-case-study/).
